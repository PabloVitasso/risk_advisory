last_session: 2025-12-28
status: shipped

## Summary
- Shipped GitHub Pages site (hakal.github.io/team_skills)
- Added Code Review Protocol to TEAM.md
- Added Invocation Protocol (team = personas, not subagents)
- Added Handoff Protocol to TEAM.md
- Expanded Gary (UX Guru) and Gabe (Red Team)
- Created 4 security beads for zen-mode (P0-P2)
- Evaluated mcp_agent_mail and AutoGen - tabled both
- First community interaction - responded to GitHub issue on self-organization

## Decisions Made
- Team members are personas in same context, NOT Task subagents
- Static HTML > complex infrastructure for simple needs
- Per-project handoff files, not global
- Reba reviews all code, Matt for security-sensitive
- master is default branch (deleted stale skill_team)

## Open Threads
- [ ] zen-mode scope-limited trust PR (zen-p9i) - ready to implement
- [ ] Safety Rail #4 references deleted skill_team branch - needs user override to fix

## Next Session
Continue with zen security work, or test handoff by loading this context.
