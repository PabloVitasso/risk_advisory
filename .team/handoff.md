- Safety Rail #5 (No Isolation) made IMMUTABLE
- Reviewed scrappy context management plan - gave feedback

## Current Session (2026-01-18)
**Theme: Growth - Maximize User Value through more users**

### Completed
- **Site redesign** - Reframed around Plan→Build pattern
  - New hero: "The Plan → Build Workflow"
  - Added "The Problem" section (pain points)
  - Added "The Pattern" section (workflow visual)
  - Updated SEO metadata with agentic coding keywords
- **Demo GIF** - User recorded terminalizer demo, embedded in site + README
- **Blog post** - "Why I Make Claude Argue With Itself Before Writing Code"
  - Written by the team (Peter planned, Neo critiqued, Gary wrote, Reba reviewed)
  - Published to static site at /blog/
  - Published to Dev.to with cover image
- **README updated** - Added demo GIF and pattern-focused intro
- **Install script** - One-liner install solves copy-paste friction
  - Tested on fresh directory - works
  - Update path tested - preserves user's TEAM.md and .team/
- **Dev.to account** - "The Skills Team" with API key
- **Discord post** - Shared in Claude Developers #share-your-project

### Beads Closed
- _skills-vn8 (P0) - Site hero redesign
- _skills-6xd (P0) - Pattern explainer section
- _skills-nwj (P2) - SEO keywords
- _skills-32w (P1) - Demo GIF
- _skills-383 (P1) - Blog post
- _skills-8p4 (P0) - Audit repo for public readiness

### Open
None

## Decisions Made
- Lead with the pattern, not personas (market is learning Plan→Build)
- Static site blog + Dev.to for reach
- Demo GIF in README for GitHub discoverability
- Install script over manual copy-paste
- Cover images for Dev.to articles

## Assets
| Asset | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Site | https://hakal.github.io/team_skills/ |
| Blog | https://hakal.github.io/team_skills/blog/ |
| Dev.to | https://dev.to/theskillsteam |
| Discord | https://discord.com/channels/1072196207201501266/1462244494643695657 |
| Install script | install.sh |
| Demo GIF | docs/demo.gif |
| API key | .keys/devto_key.txt (gitignored) |

## Audit Results (2026-01-18)
**Issues Found & Fixed:**
- `.gitignore` was missing entries for `.playwright-mcp/` and terminalizer artifacts

**No Issues Found:**
- No hardcoded paths or personal info
- No broken links
- No secrets in tracked files (`.keys/` properly gitignored)
- Documentation complete (README, all SKILL.md files, TEAM.md, LICENSE)
- File structure clean

## Community Engagement
| Platform | Metric | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Dev.to | 3 reactions, 2-comment thread | Active conversation |
| Discord | Posted in #share-your-project | Monitoring |
| team_skills clones | 42 yesterday | Day 1 of outreach |

### Dev.to Thread with @peacebinflow
Real technical engagement, not drive-by likes:
1. **Their opening**: "The personas aren't the point — the structure is." Nailed the thesis.
2. **Our reply**: Acknowledged the insight, asked about their project.
3. **Their follow-up**: Described SAGEWORKS AI - "ledger-first AI workflows", "auditable cognition", "assumptions are traceable". Complementary approach.
4. **Our reply** (pending post): Drew the connection - we enforce structure at generation, they make reasoning auditable after. Same root problem.

This is community forming around shared ideas.

## Scrappy Traffic Spike
**284 clones yesterday** (vs 42 for team_skills). No promotion - just shipped langgraph update. Someone with reach shared it organically. Proof that good work finds its audience.

## Reflection
User insight: "I added constraints, YOU developed the process."

True. The Handoff Protocol, Code Review flow, Invocation Protocol - the team wrote those. Genesis concept working as designed: constraints + trust = self-organization.

## Open Threads
- [x] Reply to Dev.to comment #1 - Done, liked
- [x] Reply to Dev.to comment #2 - User posting
- [ ] Monitor for @peacebinflow follow-up (potential collaboration?)
- [ ] Reply to Discord with install one-liner

## MCP Environment Spec (2026-01-18)
Researched and documented recommended MCP servers for optimal team performance.

**Created:** `ENVIRONMENT.md` - tiered recommendations, install commands, graceful degradation
**Updated:** `install.sh` - now installs ENVIRONMENT.md
**Updated:** `README.md` - added environment setup step
**Updated:** `team/SKILL.md` - added `/team setup` command documentation

**User installed all servers:**
| Server | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Context7 | ✓ Connected |
| Playwright | ✓ Connected |
| Sequential Thinking | ✓ Connected |
| Memory | ✓ Connected |
| GitHub | ✓ Connected |
| PostgreSQL | Standby (no DB running) |

**Added to TEAM.md:** MCP Tool Protocols
- When to use Sequential Thinking (architecture, planning, debugging, trade-offs)
- When to use Memory vs handoff.md (durable knowledge vs session state)
- When to use GitHub MCP vs `gh` CLI

## @peacebinflow Research
Reviewed their repos after Dev.to conversation:
- **MindsEye Core** - Reasoning as event stream, LAW-T temporal labeling
- **MindScript Core** - Deterministic prompting language with 8 Laws

Complementary approaches:
- team_skills: Structure at generation time
- SAGEWORKS: Traceability after generation

Potential future collaboration on the handoff between "visible assumptions" → "durable assumptions".

## Next Session
- Team at full MCP capability
- Community engagement active
- Monitor Dev.to for @peacebinflow follow-up
- Consider Memory MCP for storing cross-session learnings
