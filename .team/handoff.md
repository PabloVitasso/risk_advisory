## Summary (Previous Session: 2026-01-01)
- zen-mode security changes accepted and committed
- Safety Rail #4 updated (stale branch reference removed)
- QuantumNiyam conversation concluded - recognized social engineering pattern

## Current Session (2026-01-17)
- User shared cass-memory system (`cm`) for team consideration
- Full team discussion: Peter (excited), Neo (skeptical), Reba (cautious)
- **Voted unanimously** for Autonomous Team Workflow (`/team <task>`)
- Split on Learnings Protocol - tabled for informal experimentation
- Tested autonomous workflow on two tasks (Playwright navigation, changelog+docs update)
- Helped user respond to GitHub issue on scrappy (Nomic embedding request)
- Drafted revised README for scrappy
- **Reviewed LangGraph migration progress** - user followed our plan, exceeded targets

## Learnings (cm-inspired)
- **Memory should decay without validation** - knowledge needs re-confirmation
- **Inflection points > every run** - log what matters, not everything
- **Discipline before tooling** - try manually before automating
- **Counterfactual value is invisible** - mistakes not made can't be measured

## Learnings (LangGraph migration review)
- **Plans overestimate deletion, underestimate addition** - predicted 1.4K lines added, actual 7.2K
- **LangGraph replaces control flow, not infrastructure** - task_router/agent deleted, orchestrator/context kept
- **"Simplify" doesn't mean "delete features"** - original plan was too aggressive
- **User judgment > rigid plan adherence** - user correctly kept modules the plan said to delete

## Decisions Made
- Team members are personas in same context, NOT Task subagents
- Static HTML > complex infrastructure for simple needs
- Per-project handoff files, not global
- Reba reviews all code, Matt for security-sensitive
- **NEW**: Autonomous workflow approved - team can run full dev cycle on `/team <task>`

## Open Threads
- [x] Draft Autonomous Workflow Protocol for TEAM.md - DONE
- [x] Add Safety Rail #5 (No Isolation) to make subagent ban IMMUTABLE - DONE
- [x] Update /team skill with autonomous command - DONE

## Next Session
Test autonomous workflow with real task. `/team <task>` ready for use.
